# blue_ring
Welcome! This app represents the rebuilding of a two year old pet project to track daily activities and make a prediction on whether the day was positive or negative. This will help users determine if they need to make modifications to their daily activities. 

Currently, the majority of the working code is located in the "OG" folder: https://github.com/NPC-STL/blue_ring/tree/main/og/og. This code is reminiscient of the original project. However, it includes improvements to the efficiency of the code and reduces the reliance on 3rd-party libraries.
